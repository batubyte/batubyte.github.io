    <h2>The Little Prince and "The Drunkard"</h2>
    <p>In the book <em>The Little Prince</em> by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, there is a man called "The Drunkard." He has a bad habit too.</p>
    <blockquote>
        "Why do you drink?" said the Little Prince. <br>
        "To forget," said the man. <br>
        "Forget what?" <br>
        "To forget I am ashamed." <br>
        "Ashamed of what?" <br>
        "Ashamed because I drink."
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is a cycle. It is like smoking. People feel bad, then smoke again. We must break this cycle.</p>

    <h2>Positive Habits for a Healthy Life</h2>
    <p>We learn that addictions can have bad consequences. But we can choose good habits. These habits help us feel better and stay strong.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do sports or exercise.</li>
        <li>Draw, paint, or make music.</li>
        <li>Write in a journal. (Devin)</li>
        <li>Try mindfulness or deep breathing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will make fun workshops at school. Students can try these activities and listen to others. We will also make a board at school with tips and stories. The school counselor will help us too.</p>
