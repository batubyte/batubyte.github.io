  <h2>A Lesson from <em>The Little Prince</em></h2>
  <p>In <em>The Little Prince</em> by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, there is a character called "The Drunkard" who drinks to forget his mistakes and escape the bad reality of his life. However, drinking only increases his feelings of shame, trapping him in a painful, self-destructive cycle.</p>
  <p>This story helps us understand addiction: people often turn to harmful habits to avoid difficult emotions, but these habits usually make things worse. It shows why quitting is so hard, because the addiction is not just physical, but also emotional and psychological.</p>
  <p>Like the Drunkard, smokers can feel stuck in this cycle. But by recognizing how these patterns work, and with the right support and healthier habits, breaking free is possible. It starts with awareness and kindness toward ourselves.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>True Change Comes From Within</h2>
  <p>No matter how much we try to help you with your addiction, you have to want it yourself. Our support can only reach you if you truly want to change with your own desire.</p>
  <p>No one can force you to quit unless you are ready to take action yourself. Support, guidance, and resources can light the path, but it’s your own decision and strength that will move you forward, towards health and your well being. You are the one who must take the first step and when you do, everything will begin to change rapidly.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Healthy Alternatives and Positive Habits</h2>
  <p>Replacing harmful habits with positive actions builds strength and happiness:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Engage in sports or regular physical activities.</li>
    <li>Explore creative arts like painting, music, or writing journals.</li>
    <li>Practice mindfulness, meditation, and deep breathing.</li>
    <li>Join clubs or social groups that promote healthy lifestyles.</li>
    <li>Set personal goals and celebrate achievements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your school counselor is available for extra help and advice.</p>
